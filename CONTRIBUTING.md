# Contributing to event-driven-open-weather-insight

Thanks for your interest in this project!

Right now, this repository is primarily a personal learning and demo project.
I'm not actively accepting code contributions or feature requests at this time.

## Can I open issues or PRs?

- **Issues:** If you spot a clear bug, you’re welcome to open an issue with details.
  I may not respond quickly, but I do read them.
- **Pull requests:** Please don’t open unsolicited PRs. They will most likely be
  closed without merge.

If you're seriously interested in collaborating or have ideas that align with the
project’s goals, you can reach out to me via GitHub (issue or discussion) and we
can talk about it.

## Why this policy?

This project is part of a broader effort to explore data engineering patterns,
open data sources, and event-driven architecture. Keeping a tight control over
the codebase helps me iterate quickly and keep the scope focused.
